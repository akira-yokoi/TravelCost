CSV
===

Formatting data to the comma-separated values format is a simple task, but this library aims to make it even easier.

Rows are components within tables, which act as composites. A serializer visits each row, formatting as it goes.

Rows are added to a table:

    CSVRow *header = [[CSVRow alloc] initWithValues:@[@"Name", @"Age", @"Country"]];
    CSVRow *ryan = [[CSVRow alloc] initWithValues:@[@"Ryan Davies", @20, @"England"]];
    CSVRow *john = [[CSVRow alloc] initWithValues:@[@"John Smith", @34, @"France"]];
    CSVTable *table = [[CSVTable alloc] initWithRows:@[header, ryan, john]];
    
And serialized:

    NSMutableString *output = [[NSMutableString alloc] init];
    CSVSerializer *serializer = [[CSVExporter alloc] initWithOutput:output];
    [exporter serialize:table];
    
Initializing a serializer with a mutable string both exposes for testing and allows the same string to be used in multiple serializations, or other processes.

The above example results in the output:

    Name, Age, Country
    Ryan Davies, 20, England
    John Smith, 34, France
    
Importing this into Excel or Numbers results in a properly formatted spreadsheet.

Installation
============

CSV is installed using [CocoaPods](http://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) by adding `pod 'CSV', '~> 0.0.1'` to your project's Podfile.
